      <title>Exploring Emergent Auto-Scaling</title>

      <description>I noted that services tend to become smaller and more intelligent. Microservices for instance now encompass various resiliency mechanisms such as active queue management (AQM), auto-scaling or retry/back-off to name only a few. As services are distributed in nature, I am wondering what behaviour will emerge from interactions of such autonomous (micro-)services.
While reading &amp;ldquo;Signals and Boundaries&amp;rdquo; (Holland 2012), I wonder about the simplest model that could lead, for instance, to a feature like auto-scaling.</description>

      <title>Permutation Partity</title>

      <description>Everyday, I try to solve one simple programming challenge. Last week, I stumble upon the &amp;ldquo;Larry&amp;rsquo;s Array&amp;rdquo; challenge, a variation around the 15 tiles puzzle. I explain below the problem and the though process that I followed to reach a solution.
The Problem The problem is actually very brief. Given a permutation of the $N$ first integer&amp;mdash; say $(1,3,2,4,6,5)$&amp;mdash; we must decide whether it is possible to sort it using only 3-step wide circular permutations, one such that transforms $(a,b,c)$ into $(b, c, a)$.</description>

      <title>The Reviews I Wish to Get</title>

      <description>As a researcher, I submit research articles for peer-review. The reviews I get are unfortunately too often deceptive&amp;mdash;not only because most are rebuttals. These reviews are of very little use, beyond improving my broken English.
Below are the key points I wish reviewers would discuss. As a matter of fact, I do also consider them when I write reviews. While I am aware of the time it takes to write a detailed review, I am convinced that it does help moving research in the right direction.</description>

      <title>FLaP v0.4 is Out!</title>

      <description>I released yesterday version 0.4 of FLaP! It now flattens LaTeX files included using the LaTeX subfiles package. Besides, I fixed several bugs that had been reported on GitHub, including:
 Fix flattening \bibliography stored in a subdirectory Fix bug on \graphicpath directives using double curly braces (e.g., \graphicpath{{./img/}}). Fix bugs on \input directives:  \input directives that specify the .tex extension are properly handled; Relative paths specified in \input are considered from the root directory of the latex project, as LaTeX does.</description>

      <title>How to Automatically Deploy on Gandi?</title>

      <description>I host fchauvel.net (this very website) on Gandi.net. I use Hugo to generate it and I explain below how, each time I update its content, I automatically upload the new website.
Upload to Gandi.net using LFTP Gandi offers several hosting solutions, from which I have chosen simple hosting. Generally, I use rsync or scp to upload all my content in one go, but Gandi restricts access to either SFTP or GIT.</description>

      <title>Getting more productive!</title>

      <description>I am often disappointed by my daily organisation: I discard many of my projects, and most of them do not live to my expectations. One thing that especially bugs me is to fail making progress on multiple projects at the same time. I am diving into one particular project and, when I emerge two weeks later, every other things have gone bad. This is especially true for development tasks, where I get bogged down, consistently.</description>

      <description>I read Good to Great in January 2016. An awesome read sharing detailed analysis on how good companies became great. Let&amp;rsquo;s try LaTeX equations $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x^{i+\alpha}$$!.</description>
