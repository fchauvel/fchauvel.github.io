      <title>Exploring Emergent Auto-Scaling</title>

      <description>I noted that services tend to become smaller and more intelligent. Microservices for instance now encompass various resiliency mechanisms such as active queue management (AQM), auto-scaling or retry/back-off to name only a few. As services are distributed in nature, I am wondering what behaviour will emerge from interactions of such autonomous (micro-)services.
While reading &amp;ldquo;Signals and Boundaries&amp;rdquo; (Holland 2012), I wonder about the simplest model that could lead, for instance, to a feature like auto-scaling.</description>

      <description>As a researcher, I submit research articles for peer-review. The reviews I get are unfortunately too often deceptive—not only because most are rebuttals. These reviews are of very little use, beyond improving my broken English.
Below are the key points I wish reviewers would discuss. As a matter of fact, I do also consider them when I write reviews. While I am aware of the time it takes to write a detailed review, I am convinced that it does help moving research in the right direction.</description>

      <description>Research Interests I am a software engineer who ended up doing applied research. My interests therefore revolve about programmin, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.
  Complex Adaptive Systems fascinates me, especially distributed ones. I observe that as software systems grow in both in size and complexity and include more AI, they resemble complex adaptive systems, whose behaviour is difficult to understand, let alone to predict.
  Agile Software Development and the software craftsmanship ideas struck me as obvious once we know them.</description>
