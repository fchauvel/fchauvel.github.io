      <description>I recently released quick-check, a JS library to easily declare data schema and validate and convert data accordinly.
Why Yet Another Library? I did not find anything that fits my need. I ended up writing some boiler-plate code, code to convert object trees (i.e., maps and lists) into home-grown classes, first while working on the CAMP project (Python), and then on my RPP project.
I did find though libraries to convert JSON files into home-grown classes, using annotations for instance, but in my case, I needed to accept both objects trees from multiple syntax files, say TOML and YAML for instance, which I parsed using different libraries.</description>

      <description>I like coding and I am lucky enough to get the opportunity to develop open source software as part of my job. I have been involved in development of the tools including:
  GeneSIS helps you deploy and monitor complex smart IoT systems.
  CAMP helps you amplify your configuration tests. Given your docker resources, CAMP will run your tests in multiple environments, giving you confidence!
  CloudML helps you deploys your application accross multiple clouds, such as AWS, Azure, etc.</description>
