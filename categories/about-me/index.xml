      <description>I like building software and I am lucky enough to get the opportunity to develop open source tools as part of my job. Below are some I have contributed to:
 CAMP helps developers amplify integration tests and configuration tests. Given a test sample and variability models CAMP generates, build and execute your tests on many alternatives environments.
 MAD is a simulator of self-adaptive software architectures. MAD captures the interplay of so-called &amp;lsquo;defencive&amp;rsquo; mechanisms (e.</description>

      <description>Research Interests I am a software engineer who ended up doing applied research. My interests therefore revolve about programming and software engineering.
 Complex Adaptive Systems fascinates me, especially distributed ones. I observe that as software systems grow in both in size and complexity, they resemble complex adaptive systems, whose behaviour is difficult to understand, let alone to predict.
 Agile Software Development and the software craftsmanship ideas struck me as obvious once we know them.</description>

      <description>It is me, the guy who publish this website.
What am I looking for? I am a programmer researching for better ways to design and implement self-adaptive systems, that is systems that automatically adjust to their environment. I am looking for opportunities to evaluate research ideas in industrial settings, especially around Cloud technologies.
My current objective is to detect, at design-time, performances issues due to interactions between feedback loops, using simulation of architectural models.</description>
