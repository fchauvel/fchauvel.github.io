      <description>Do you feel that you never have any idea or that your ideas are irrelevant or impractial? This book tells how to generate ideas by reading and taking notes!
Yet another book that Goodreads.com recommended. I always felt my notes taking is inadequate: In meetings, I often note only the irrelevant. But this is not about writing meeting minutes. It is about taking generating ideas by taking notes while readingâ€”as the subtitle says.</description>

      <description>I am often disappointed by my daily organisation: I discard many of my projects, and most of them do not live to my expectations. One thing that especially bugs me is to fail making progress on multiple projects at the same time. I am diving into one particular project and, when I emerge two weeks later, every other things have gone bad. This is especially true for development tasks, where I get bogged down, consistently.</description>
