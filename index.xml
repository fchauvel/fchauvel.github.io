      <title>Exploring Emergent Auto-Scaling</title>

      <description>I noted that services tend to become smaller and more intelligent. Microservices for instance now encompass various resiliency mechanisms such as active queue management (AQM), auto-scaling or retry/back-off to name only a few. As services are distributed in nature, I am wondering what behaviour will emerge from interactions of such autonomous (micro-)services.
While reading &amp;ldquo;Signals and Boundaries&amp;rdquo; (Holland 2012), I wonder about the simplest model that could lead, for instance, to a feature like auto-scaling.</description>

      <title>The Reviews I Wish to Get</title>

      <description>As a researcher, I submit research articles for peer-review. The reviews I get are unfortunately too often deceptive—not only because most are rebuttals. These reviews are of very little use, beyond improving my broken English.
Below are the key points I wish reviewers would discuss. As a matter of fact, I do also consider them when I write reviews. While I am aware of the time it takes to write a detailed review, I am convinced that it does help moving research in the right direction.</description>

      <title>How to Automatically Deploy on Gandi?</title>
      <link>//fchauvel.github.io/2016/08/28/how-to-automatically-deploy-on-gandi/</link>

      <description>I host fchauvel.net (this very website) on Gandi.net. I use Hugo to generate it and I explain below how, each time I update its content, I automatically upload the new website.
Upload to Gandi.net using LFTP Gandi offers several hosting solutions, from which I have chosen simple hosting. Generally, I use rsync or scp to upload all my content in one go, but Gandi restricts access to either SFTP or GIT.</description>

      <description>I am often disappointed by my daily organisation: I discard many of my projects, and most of them do not live to my expectations. One thing that especially bugs me is to fail making progress on multiple projects at the same time. I am diving into one particular project and, when I emerge two weeks later, every other things have gone bad. This is especially true for development tasks, where I get bogged down, consistently.</description>

      <description>I like coding and I am lucky enough to get the opportunity to develop open source software as part of my job. I have been involved in development of the tools including:
  CAMP helps you amplify your configuration tests. Given your docker resources, CAMP will run your tests in multiple environments, giving you confidence!
  CloudML helps you deploys your application accross multiple clouds, such as AWS, Azure, etc.</description>

      <description>Research Interests I am a software engineer who ended up doing applied research. My interests therefore revolve about programming and software engineering.
  Complex Adaptive Systems fascinates me, especially distributed ones. I observe that as software systems grow in both in size and complexity, they resemble complex adaptive systems, whose behaviour is difficult to understand, let alone to predict.
  Agile Software Development and the software craftsmanship ideas struck me as obvious once we know them.</description>

      <title>Who is Franck?</title>
      <link>//fchauvel.github.io/biography/</link>

      <description>It is me, the guy who publish this website.
What am I looking for? I am a programmer researching for better ways to design and implement self-adaptive systems, that is systems that automatically adjust to their environment. I am looking for opportunities to evaluate research ideas in industrial settings, especially around Cloud technologies.
My current objective is to detect, at design-time, performances issues due to interactions between feedback loops, using simulation of architectural models.</description>
