      <description>Do you feel that you never have any idea or that your ideas are irrelevant or impractical? This book tells how to generate ideas by reading and taking notes!
Yet another book that Goodreads.com recommended. I always felt my notes taking is inadequate: In meetings, I often note only the irrelevant. But this is not about writing meeting minutes. It is about taking generating ideas by taking notes while reading—as the subtitle says.</description>

      <description>As a researcher, I submit research articles for peer-review. The reviews I get are unfortunately too often deceptive—not only because most are rebuttals. These reviews are of very little use, beyond improving my broken English.
Below are the key points I wish reviewers would discuss. As a matter of fact, I do also consider them when I write reviews. While I am aware of the time it takes to write a detailed review, I am convinced that it does help moving research in the right direction.</description>
